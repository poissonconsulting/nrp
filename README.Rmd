# nrp

`nrp` is an R package that is being developed for the Nutrient Restoration Program (NRP) to

- read the various data files used by the program;
- upload data to the NRP SQLite database; and
- produce key tables and plots based on the data in the NRP SQLite database.

Currently we are working on functions to read CTD files.

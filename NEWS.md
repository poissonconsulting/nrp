# nrp 0.1.1 (2025-08-07)

- Removed EMS information from `README` as the EMS system, from a separate government database, has undergone major revisions. The new EMS system should be released November 2025, at which point we will discuss with the client if EMS functions should still be included and maintained.
- Removed all instances of `.data$` to align with current tidyverse syntax.

# nrp 0.1.0 (2025-08-07)

- Created `NEWS` file to record changes to package.
